        <dt>Learning how users interact with web applications is one of the most fundamental 
            pieces of your web development toolbox. How is using JavaScript to interact with 
            an application important? Just like your video explanations I would like to see 
            and hear about some specific real world examples.
        </dt>
        <dd>Here's a specific real world example: <br> I'm aspiring to start my own business 
            called equi(LIBERAL)ium that helps Left-leaning/Liberal activists build their Causes 
            advertise their Causes, collaborate with one another, & plan events/ protests.
        </dd>
        <br><br>
        <dt>You have seen a lot of hardships caused by not knowing about the DOM or JavaScript 
            answered in this course (think event listeners instead of complex UI animations for 
            navbar interactions). What were some of the things made easier by learning about DOM 
            interactions? What was hard, difficult, or surprising to you and why?
        </dt>
        <dd>I gotta say, every aspect was difficult for me... but I've always seemed to struggle 
            with JavaScript while flourishing in HTML & CSS. But around the end of the course, I 
            started getting more of a hang on it after A LOT of practice (as I am a hands on 
            learner)...
        </dd>
        <br><br>
        <dt>What do you feel was your biggest accomplishment in this course?</dt>
        <dd>Learning how to create input sections on my webpage. It'll be extremely helpful with my 
            "Activist Assistance" Program where I help Left leaning groups collaborate,  
        </dd>
